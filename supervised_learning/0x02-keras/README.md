# Introduction to Keras Project

## Tools Created:

* build_model(nx, layers, activations, lambtha, keep_prob):

> Builds a neural network with the Keras library.

* build_model(nx, layers, activations, lambtha, keep_prob):

> Builds a neural network with the Keras library.

* optimize_model(network, alpha, beta1, beta2):

> Sets up Adam optimization for a keras model with categorical crossentropy loss and accuracy metrics.

* one_hot(labels, classes=None):

> One hot encode function to be used to reshape Y_label vector.
