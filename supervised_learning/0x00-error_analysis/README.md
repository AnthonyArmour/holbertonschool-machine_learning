# 0x00-Error_Anaylysis Project

This project is about understanding statistical errors for applied machine learning. Below are methods that we create that directly represent what this project was about.

## Error_Anaylysis Tools Made

* create_confusion_matrix(labels, logits):

> Creates a confusion matrix.

* sensitivity(confusion):

> Calculates the sensitivity for each class in a confusion matrix.

* precision(confusion):

> Calculates the precision for each class in a confusion matrix

* specificity(confusion):

> Calculates the specificity for each class in a confusion matrix
